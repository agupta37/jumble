# Jumble Solver

This code prints matching “sub-anagrams” from the word entered. The program can find words that use a subset of the
provided letters, as well as true anagrams that use every letter.

### How to run the code

Navigate to inside **jumble folder** and run the following command:

`python main.py --word [EXAMPLE WORD]`

### Reference

About jumble: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumble
Example word list: http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt

The code uses the above-mentioned word list by default but any file can be used by mentioning `--file [PATH TO FILE]`
while running the code

### Complexity Analysis

The first function gen_char_dict() runs once and travers through the word inputted. Considering the length of the
inputted word is 'n' the complexity is O(n)

The second function gen_sub_anagrams() consists of 2 nested for loops. It goes through all the words in the word list
and travers each word char by char until a char that is not available in the char_dict generated by the gen_char_dict()
function shows up.

Considering there are 'n' words and the max length of one word in the word list is 'm' the complexity of this part will
be O(n x m)

O(n x m) is much higher than O(n) so the overall complexity of the code will be O(n x m)
